# VBA Challenge

This is homework number 2 for Data Visualizations and analytics Bootcamp

## Visual Basics Challenge

## Overview

This project uses VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The scripts loop through stock data for each quarter and output the following information:

- Ticker symbol

- Quarterly change from the opening price to the closing price

- Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price

- Total stock volume

## Features

- Calculate the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume

- Conditional formatting highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red

- Script setup is broken into 3 macros: `Sub Reset` clears the run macros and leaves the set columns and formatting. `Sub stock_change`
loops through the worksheets and outputs the ticker changes. `Sub summary_table` creates the table displaying the top changed stocks.

## How to Use

- Running the Script: Open the Excel file and run the VBA script to analyze the data.

- Output: The script will display the ticker symbol, quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.

## Requirements

- VBA-compatible version of Excel
